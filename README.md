This exercize is building a feature of this game, which displays and moves PacMan from one side of the screen to the other. 

## Task Description

My task in this activity is to update the starter code to create a pacman and move these pacmen across the page.

* **Task 1**: Create a pacman on demand (button click) 
* **Task 2**: Move these pacmen across the page


 ## Installation

* **Step 1**: Download all documents from the PacMen Factory file: Index.html, pacman.js, README.md files, and the Images folder
* **Step 2**: Open the Index.html file

 ## Usage

* **#1** When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen.
* **#2** When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
* **#3** When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.

 Also, you could check the README.md developed leveraging these sources:
 * [An example](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/master/README.md) of a well-formatted and well-maintained README file.
 * Review the [markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and [markdown live preview](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) to learn more about the syntax.

## Support

You can email me at cpodgurschi@gmail.com for help regarding this project. 

## Roadmap

Changing the image when PacMan touches the edges of the screen, disapear when it collides with another PacMan
